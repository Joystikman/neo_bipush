##What is this
This is a crappy vuejs framework that use google sheet as database.
I wanted something way more simple than the nuclear power plant (aka Wordpress) I use today to publish my annual post.
Probably broke but it works ðŸ¤– 

## How to use it
Create a google sheet wich list :
* website name
* a description
* an url
* a twitter account

And in a second page, write your posts (and inquire the following informations) :
* id
* title
* thumbnail
* content
* media
* published 
* date

Then, publish your sheet on https://sheety.co/ , and complete your config.js file. VoilÃ  â˜¢
